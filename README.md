## ‚úÖ How to attend the workshop?

### **üñãÔ∏è To register for the workshop**
1) üí™ Complete the [test task](./test/test-task.md);
2) üì• Submit the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxswHl5hr61PN1hd0w_RNbzDXfuin_NjLeb92TXDLRVb8Y7A/viewform?fbclid=PAAaZ2LgH4N3ltCEKLkgdMRwd9OGTX5MtzhDQqidcX5TLOdK-VhpsZfIKQaOQ).

## üìù Workshop Requirements

Before attending the workshop, please ensure you have the following:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Node.js

You will need Node.js version 16 or above. We recommend managing your Node.js versions using NVM (Node Version Manager) if you are using MacOS or Ubuntu.

- MacOS or Ubuntu: [Install NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- Windows: [Install Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To check your Node version, open a terminal and run:

```bash
node -v
```

If you've successfully installed Node.js, it should print the version number.

### üì¶ Workshop Repository

You will need to clone the workshop repository which contains all the necessary files and examples we will be working on.

Repository: `git@github.com:DrSmile444/complete-typescript-workshop.git`

To clone the repository, open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DrSmile444/complete-typescript-workshop.git
```

This will create a new directory named `complete-typescript-workshop` containing all the files from the repository. Navigate into it with:

```bash
cd complete-typescript-workshop
```

On the start of the session, ensure you have the latest changes by pulling from the repository:

```bash
git pull
```

Please make sure to have all of these ready before the workshop. If you have any issues, don't hesitate to reach out to us for assistance.

Looking forward to seeing you at the workshop!


## üìö Workshop Plan

To ensure a smooth and organized learning experience, we have moved the detailed workshop plan into a separate Markdown file.

**You can access the full plan by clicking [here](./workshop/Plan.md).**

In the comprehensive workshop plan, you will find a breakdown of the entire TypeScript workshop curriculum, including the three main topics:

- üìö Introduction to TypeScript
- üå± Basic Concepts
- üî• Advanced Topics

Each topic is covered in depth, with detailed explanations, examples, and exercises to help you grasp the concepts effectively.

## ü§î Why This Workshop?

The programming landscape is rapidly evolving, and TypeScript has emerged as a vital tool for building robust, scalable, and maintainable applications. By introducing static types, TypeScript enhances JavaScript with improved tooling, better collaboration, and additional constructs that greatly increase the quality of your code.

Our goal is to provide you with a deep understanding of TypeScript, from basic syntax and concepts to advanced features like generics, conditional types, and more. We believe that understanding these concepts will empower you to write better, more reliable, and more maintainable code.

## üß† What Will You Learn?

By attending this workshop, you will:

- Gain a solid understanding of TypeScript's basics: types, interfaces, functions, classes, and enumerations.
- Learn about advanced TypeScript topics: generics, union and intersection types, type inference, conditional types, mapped types, type aliases, and decorators.
- Understand the practical uses of the `never` and `unknown` types in TypeScript.
- Gain hands-on experience with TypeScript through practical tasks and real-world examples.
- Learn best practices for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable TypeScript code.
- Have an opportunity to clarify your doubts and learn directly from experienced TypeScript developers.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Who Should Attend?

This workshop is perfect for:

- JavaScript developers looking to learn TypeScript
- Front-end and back-end developers who wish to improve their type skills
- Developer teams wanting to introduce TypeScript into their projects
- Students and professionals looking to expand their knowledge and skills in web development
