# üî• 3. Advanced Topics

Welcome to the third and exciting topic of our TypeScript workshop: Advanced Topics! In this section, we will explore advanced concepts and techniques that will take your TypeScript skills to the next level. Let's dive in and uncover the üî• advanced features of TypeScript!

## Subtopics

This topic comprises several subtopics, each delving into a specific advanced concept in TypeScript. Here's an overview of what we'll cover:

1. [üî§ Generics](./3-advanced-topics/Generics.md)
  - Using generics with functions, classes, and interfaces
  - Generic constraints
  - Using EXTENDS to constrain generics (Advanced TypeScript)
  - Improving OBJECT.KEYS in TypeScript (Advanced TypeScript)
  - Mastering Generic Slots in TypeScript (Advanced TypeScript)
  - Overloads vs. Generics: Which is better? (Advanced TypeScript)

2. [üîÄ Union and Intersection Types](./3-advanced-topics/UnionAndIntersectionTypes.md)
  - Combining and intersecting types
  - Discriminated unions
  - Removing a member of a Union Type
  - Building LOOSE AUTOCOMPLETE with TypeScript
  - Turn MODULES INTO TYPES with typeof import (Advanced TypeScript)

3. [üß† Type Inference](./3-advanced-topics/TypeInference.md)
  - Automatic type inference
  - Type assertions

4. [‚ùì Conditional Types](./3-advanced-topics/ConditionalTypes.md)
  - Basic syntax and usage
  - Distributive conditional types

5. [üó∫Ô∏è Mapped Types](./3-advanced-topics/MappedTypes.md)
  - Creating new types based on existing ones
