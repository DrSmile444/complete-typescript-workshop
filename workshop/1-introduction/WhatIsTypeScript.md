# What is TypeScript?

* TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations to the language.
* TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript, which can be executed in any JavaScript environment (browser, Node.js,
  etc.).
* Developed and maintained by Microsoft.

Code example:

  ```typescript
  function greet(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const userName: string = 'John';
console.log(greet(userName)); // Output: Hello, John!
  ```
