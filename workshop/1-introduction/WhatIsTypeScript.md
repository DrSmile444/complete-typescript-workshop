# ðŸ§ª What is TypeScript?

* TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations to the language.
* TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript, which can be executed in any JavaScript environment (browser, Node.js,
  etc.).
* Developed and maintained by Microsoft.

Code example:

  ```typescript
  function greet(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const userName: string = 'John';
console.log(greet(userName)); // Output: Hello, John!
  ```

## TypeScript Playground

[TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) is a browser-based interactive compiler that lets you write TypeScript or JavaScript code, then see the TypeScript compiler's output. It's an invaluable tool for learning TypeScript, experimenting with the language, or debugging your code. Here's what you can do in the TypeScript Playground:

### TypeScript and JavaScript

TypeScript Playground supports both TypeScript and JavaScript code. You can write TypeScript, see the JavaScript output instantly, and observe how different TypeScript features translate to JavaScript.

### Compiler Options

You can configure the TypeScript compiler options directly in the Playground. Click on the "Options" button to see all the compiler flags and modify them as needed. For example, you can enable `strict` mode or change the target ECMAScript version.

### Error Reporting

As you type, TypeScript Playground underlines errors and warnings in your code. Hover over an error to see the full message. This is a great way to get immediate feedback on your TypeScript code and learn how to write valid TypeScript.

### Share and Save

Once you have a piece of code you'd like to share or save, click the "Share" button. This will generate a URL that encodes your code and your compiler settings. You can send this URL to others, or bookmark it to save your work.

### Embedded Documentation

TypeScript Playground provides inline documentation for standard library features and compiler errors. When you select a function or highlight an error, a sidebar appears with relevant documentation. This is a fantastic resource for learning about different TypeScript and JavaScript features.

### Playground Plugins

Playground supports plugins that add new features or support for libraries. For example, a plugin could provide autocompletion for a library, transform your TypeScript code in interesting ways, or visualize the TypeScript abstract syntax tree.

### Examples

Playground includes a variety of pre-made examples showcasing various TypeScript features. It's a great starting point to explore the capabilities of TypeScript.

Overall, TypeScript Playground is an invaluable tool for both new and experienced TypeScript developers. It allows you to experiment with the language, understand JavaScript output, share code snippets, and learn about TypeScript and JavaScript features.
