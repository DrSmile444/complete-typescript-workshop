# 🌱 2. Basic Concepts

Welcome to the second topic of our TypeScript workshop: Basic Concepts! In this section, we will explore foundational concepts in TypeScript that will empower you to write more robust and scalable code. Let's dive in and strengthen your TypeScript skills! 🌿

## Subtopics

This topic consists of several subtopics, each focusing on an essential concept in TypeScript. Here's an overview of what we'll cover:

1. [🚧 Types](./2-basic-concepts/Types.md)
  - Basic types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol
  - Array and tuple types

2. [🗺️ Interfaces](./2-basic-concepts/Interfaces.md)
  - Defining interfaces
  - Optional properties
  - Readonly properties
  - Interface vs Type
  - [Unleashing the SECRET POWER of indexed access types (Advanced TypeScript)](./2-basic-concepts/indexed-access-types.ts)

3. [📚 Functions](./2-basic-concepts/Functions.md)
  - Type annotations for function parameters and return types
  - Optional and default parameters
  - Function overloads
  - [Mastering FUNCTION OVERLOADS with 'compose' (Advanced TypeScript)](./2-basic-concepts/compose-overloads.ts)

4. [🏫 Classes](./2-basic-concepts/Classes.md)
  - Defining classes with properties and methods
  - Access modifiers: public, private, protected
  - Inheritance and abstract classes
  - Understanding when to use Class or Interface

5. [📑 Enumerations](./2-basic-concepts/Enums.md)
  - Numeric and string enums
  - Readonly enums

6. [🔍 What is index.ts](./2-basic-concepts/Index.md)

By exploring these subtopics, you will gain a strong understanding of essential concepts in TypeScript. You will learn about various types, how to define interfaces to structure your data, how to work with functions and classes, and the benefits of using enumerations. Each subtopic provides practical examples and explanations to solidify your understanding.
